## About

I've built this app for the Supabase Launch Week 8 Hackathon. It uses the following techs:

- Svelte for the UI
- Tailwind for styling
- Supabase as DB and auth
- Resend for the auth SMTP
- hCaptcha to prevent spam

Try it yourself at https://supasafe.mateus.zip and let me know what do you think!

> **Warning**
> This README is incomplete, I'm going to update it with steps and instructions on how to build the app
